	/*In our example, the createElement method takes three parameters:
	 1. HTML or component name as a string, e.g., <h1>
	 2. Data in the form of attributes and props (we'll cover props later), e.g., null or {name:
	 'Azat'}
	 3. Children, or inner HTML or content, e.g., Hello world!
	 */

	//The code to create an h1 element is in plain JavaScript.
	// All we are doing is calling createElement with three arguments.
	// As a result, we are getting an object h1which is a special React class or component:
	var h1 = React.createElement('h1', null, 'Hello World!');

	//Once the element is created, we can render it to the actual DOM element with ID example
	ReactDOM.render(h1, document.getElementById('example'));

	// Warning render(): Rendering components directly into document.body is discouraged,
	// since its children are often manipulated by third-party scripts and browser extensions.
	// This may lead to subtle reconciliation issues. Try rendering into a container element created for your app.
	//ReactDOM.render(<App />, document.body)
